# Development

## DVCS 
### Usage of branches
The project was carried out using a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
Considering the fairly simple nature of the project itself and the fact that there was only one author, it was deemed sufficient to work, for the most part, directly on the "Main" branch. Then, an additional branch for improving the readabily and graphical aspects of the application was created (called "Visual updates"). Here, the work focussed only on the visual appearence of the product, without interfering with the business logic. Once the improvements were ready, the branches were merged.

### Conventions for commits
All commits adhered to a clear and descriptive convention to ensure a high-quality, traceable history of changes. Initially, the commits' titles were kept as simple as possible, while more specific details were included in the commit description. Towards the end of the project, it was decided to use the AI generated commits, directly available on GitHub, which needed only small adjustments. These were more specific and descriptive than the initial ones, but they still remained fairly simple.
