# Idea

The Idea behind the web application "Helpinvest" is to give the possibility to users to visualize the trend of their investment portfolio in order to get a better understanding of how compound interest works. The website will have a graphical user interface where users will be able to choose the different levles of risk, the amount of money and the span of time they want to invest in. In this way they will be more informed when they will have to make decisions on how to manage their savings.
The web application will be free to use and once a sufficient number of users is reached, the introduction of advertisements could generate some income. 

# Features

The web application will be fairly simple, with a GUI that will allow the users to create different graphical representation.
As previously mentioned, the application will be fairly simple, and it will be composed of a first page where the users can choose:
- Starting capital
- Subsequent deposits
- Risk profile
- Time span

Then the web app will take these informations and generate a graph that will be displayed in a new web page, showing the possible trend of the investment portfolio in different scenarios.

# Use cases

## New investors
 - People who are new to the investing world and want to learn on how compound interest works

## Portfolio managers
 - Professional who will be able to show a graphical representation of the portfolio trend to their clients (tohugh in this case the application should include more complex formulas and more flexibility concerning the scenarios displayed)
