# Release

- What to release, where, and how

## Choice of the license

- Which one and why

## Choice of the versioning schema
Semantic Versioning (SemVer) was chosen as the versioning schema due to its status as a nearly universal standard for communicating software changes. The MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format provides a structured, standardized way to convey the impact of each update:

- **MAJOR**  denotes revolutionary, potentially breaking variations that may require dependency or environment updates.

- **MINOR**indicates the addition of new features or functionalities in a backward-compatible manner.

- **PATCH** focuses on fixing small imperfections and bugs.
